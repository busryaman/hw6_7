I chose Cursor because I saw that it is more used and preferred by many developers. At the same time, I also wanted to try Bolt.new for compare different vibe coding tools. While Bolt.new sometimes added extra features that I did not mention in my prompt and that could improve functionality, the appearance of the application looked careless and not well-designed. Cursor, on the other hand, made exactly what I asked for no missing parts and no unnecessary features. In addition Bolt.new took a long time to show the generated code.
 I prepared the main prompt using another AI tool to make sure it was clear and complete. However, I wanted to add a few extra features later, such as keeping the todos after refreshing the page, adding a date option, and using a pixel art visual style. Because of these changes, I updated the prompt a total of three times. And the tool handled the updates successfully.

I did not face any serious difficulties during development, but I did encounter one important challenge after completing the project. When I uploaded the project to GitHub, I realized that the application did not work correctly when someone else downloaded or cloned it. 
Firstly I think my friends has no Node.js in their computer but it is not about just node js it is also about my files cursor made some mistakes in my files. That’s why I hadd to change my whole project and its mean I made 3 project. Hopefully the last one works better. No white screen but the visual wasn’t like I wanted. 
I would definitely use Cursor again in future projects. I believe that artificial intelligence should be seen as a helpful tool rather than a threat to software developers. Tools that reduce time and effort can be very useful, as long as they do not weaken developers’ skills. Already ai needs to adjustment to codes and people can ensure this adjustment.
