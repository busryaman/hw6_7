I chose Cursor because I saw that it is more used and preferred by many developers. At the same time, I also wanted to try Bolt.new in order to compare different vibe coding tools. While Bolt.new sometimes added extra features that I did not mention in my prompt and that could improve functionality, the appearance of the application looked careless and not well-designed. Cursor, on the other hand, generated exactly what I asked for — no missing parts and no unnecessary features. In addition, Cursor was faster. Bolt.new took a long time to show the generated code, while Cursor also required some waiting time but it was noticeably shorter.

During the development process, I used AI at every stage. I prepared the main prompt using another AI tool to make sure it was clear and complete. However, I wanted to add a few extra features later, such as keeping the todos after refreshing the page, adding a date option, and using a pixel art visual style. Because of these changes, I updated the prompt a total of three times. Even so, I did not need to manually edit the generated code, and the tool handled the updates successfully.

I did not face any serious difficulties during development, but I did encounter one important challenge after completing the project. When I uploaded the project to GitHub, I realized that the application did not work correctly when someone else downloaded or cloned it. Because of this issue, I decided to create a new project and set it up properly so that it would run without problems on other systems.

The only technical problem I encountered during development was related to Node.js, which was not installed on my system at first. This caused an error initially, but after installing Node.js, the problem was solved and everything worked correctly. I had not used Node.js before, and this issue was not related to the AI tool itself.

I would definitely use Cursor again in future projects. I believe that artificial intelligence should be seen as a helpful tool rather than a threat to software developers. Tools that reduce time and effort can be very useful, as long as they do not weaken developers’ skills.
